# Project Motivation

Sparkify is a digital music service similar to Youtube Music and Spotify. Users can add friends or songs to their playlists, subscribe, listen to their favorite music for free (with adverts) or for a fee, and more.

In this project, we will use Spark to modify sizable, realistic datasets in order to create pertinent features for churn prediction. Small datasets will be used to create machine learning models using Spark MLlib.

## Files in the repository
- [mini_sparkify_event_data.json](mini_sparkify_event_data.json): small dataset using in this project.
- [Sparkify.ipynb](Sparkify.ipynb): code of this project.
- [graph](graph/): store chart image.

## Some Library

The code is saved in `.ipynb` file and can be run with any tool that support this file format. These are libraries that is used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pyspark
- time

## Results

For the code, please check the notebook [Sparkify.ipynb](Sparkify.ipynb).
